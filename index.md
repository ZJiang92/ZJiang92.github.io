I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working in [Professor Schleife group](http://schleife.matse.illinois.edu). My current research focuses on using first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory, to study electronic, magnetic and phonon properties of materials. I study magnon damping in hybrid magnonic systems. I am also exploring novel topological properties in condensed matter systems, for electrons as well as other elementary excitations such as phonons, plasmons and magnons. 

Before the postdoc training at UIUC, I obtained my Physics PhD in December 2021 from the University of Southern California (USC), under the supervision of Professor Stephan Haas in the group of [Computational Condensed Matter Theory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cmt/). The main research topic during my PhD was plasmonic excitations in low-dimensional quantum materials. Two particular directions were investigated: surface plasmons in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators, and 2D plasmons in layered metals tuned by inhomogeneous external screening environment. I studied tight-binding toy model Hamiltonians analytically. The numerical calculations for plasmons were done using a self-programmed code based on the random phase approximation in the real-space. In 2014, I obtained my BS in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under the supervision of Professor Zengming Zhang. The thesis work was Upconversion Luminescence of NaYF$_4$:Yb,Er Nanomaterials Doping Metal Ions (Li$^{+}$, Al$^{3+}$).

My general research interest is exploring novel properties of electrons as well as other elementary excitations in quantum condensed matter systems, using both analytical calculations on toy models and first-principles calculations for real materials. Particularly, the most interesting topics to me are topology, electron-electron correlation, electron-phonon interactions, and interplay between them.
