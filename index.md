I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working in Professor [Schleife group link]{http://schleife.matse.illinois.edu}. My current research focuses on using first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory, to study electronic, magnetic and phonon properties of materials. Particularly, I am interested in exploring novel topological properties in condensed matter systems, including electrons as well as other elementary excitations such as phonons, plasmons and magnons.
