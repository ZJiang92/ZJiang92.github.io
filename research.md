## Research Interests and Skills
My general research interest is exploring novel properties of electrons, as well as elementary excitations such as phonons, magnons, excitons, and plasmons, in quantum condensed matter systems. The systems I study include both toy models where analytical calculation with simple and empirical band theory can provide us insight into the underlying physics, and real materials or meta-materials for which first-principles simulations can be applied to achieve a more realistic description for predicting experiments or real-life situations. Particularly interesting topics to me are topology properties, electron-electron correlation, electron-phonon interactions, and possible interplay between them. 

My PhD study has enabled me aquire faithful knowledge in quantum mechanics, solid state physics, (topological) band theory, Green's function, and many-body perturbation theory. In my current postdoc training, I have learned first-principles methods for materials simulations and got familiar with popular computational packages.

## Research Experiences
### Leading Projects
#### Topological phonons and electron-phonon interaction in RhSi. 
In this on-going project, I study phonon excitations and electron-phonon interaction in RhSi, using density functional perturbation theory implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) simulations package and Wannier interpolation as implemented in EPW code. RhSi is a uniquely interesting material which was reported to have topologically non-trivial
electronic structure and is believed to be very likely having topologically non-trivial phonons for its structural similarity to a family of topological phonon materials. From my calculated bulk phonon bands, I identify topologically nontrivial Weyl nodes at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center (Γ point) and corners (R point) with opposite chiralities, i.e. χ = 2 at Γ and χ = −2 at R. Due to ”bulk-boundary correspondence”, this feature implies the existence of topological surface phonon states that manifest as iso-frequency loops connecting the projections of Γ and R on the surface BZ. To confirm this, I calculate the band structure and phonon surface density of states of a slab model, and observe mig-gap phonon states that are highly localized on the surfaces of the slab. The dispersions of these topological phonons are chiral on two opposite surfaces. Moreover, I study electron-phonon (EP) coupling in this material and calculate the phonon self-energy, from which I find the coupling strength is particularly enhanced near phonon Weyl points. The underlying physics behind this is still in exploring. I am trying to understand whether the enhanced EP coupling is related to the non-trivial topology of electrons and phonons of RhSi. Furthermore, I plan to study EP interaction on surfaces as well using a slab model. To achieve this, I will try to use real-space format of wannierised EP coupling matrix from EPW code and then apply it to the slab model by Fourier transforming only the in-plane spatial dimension.
