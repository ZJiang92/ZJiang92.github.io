## Research Interests and Skills
My general research interest is exploring novel properties of electrons as well as elementary excitations, such as phonons, magnons, excitons, and plasmons, in quantum condensed matter systems. The systems I am interested in  through both analytical calculations on toy models and first-principles simulations for real materials. Particularly, the most interesting topics to me are topology, electron-electron correlation, electron-phonon interactions, and possible interplay between them. 

My general interest for the future career continues to be exploring novel electronic, magnetic, phononic, and optical properties of condensed matter systems. I have solid background knowledges and well-developed skills for achieving research goals in these directions. During my PhD training, I learned quantum mechanics, solid state physics, topological band theory and many-body perturbation theory in detail. In my current postdoc period, I have been learning first-principles materials simulations and getting familiar with many popular computational packages such as VASP, QE, and etc as listed in my CV.
