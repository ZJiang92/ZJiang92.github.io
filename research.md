## Research Interests and Skills
My general research interest is exploring novel properties of electrons, as well as elementary excitations such as phonons, magnons, excitons, and plasmons, in quantum condensed matter systems. The systems I study include both toy models where analytical calculation with simple and empirical band theory can provide us insight into the underlying physics, and real materials or meta-materials for which first-principles simulations can be applied to achieve a more realistic description for predicting experiments or real-life situations. Particularly interesting topics to me are topology properties, electron-electron correlation, electron-phonon interactions, and possible interplay between them. 

My PhD study has enabled me aquire faithful knowledge in quantum mechanics, solid state physics, (topological) band theory, Green's function, and many-body perturbation theory. In my current postdoc training, I have learned first-principles methods for materials simulations and got familiar with popular computational packages.
